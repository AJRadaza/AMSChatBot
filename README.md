In this chat bot, the developer plans to use Facebook as their medium of communication because in the Philippines, internet service providers (i.e. Globe and Smart) give free data access to Facebook for their users. In connection to this, there are a lot of mobile phone users with internet in the country â€“ including but not limited to students. The researchers plan on taking advantage on this feature by using Facebook as a medium for the chat bot to gather data from classes to generate its class attendance. Traditionally, attendance checking involves the use of sheets of paper or books in monitoring attendance. The system will use Python for retrieving, processing, and transferring data.

Currently, there are no attendance monitoring systems that uses Facebook chat bots. It is on this gap that the developer of this study seized the opportunity to create an Attendance Monitoring System that uses Facebook chat bot.
